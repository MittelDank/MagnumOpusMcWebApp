**Contribute:**
Ideas suggestions and yes coding expertise are welcome. Everything from the front end to the backend to the multicraft api integration are open for contributions.

Install ruby 3, npm or yarn ( look that up on google for whatever system you are ) then :
`bundle`
after that fetches all the gems required for the app lets do npm/yarn
`yarn`
after all your js modules get setup

Then you should be good to run the rails server with:
`rails s`
and if you want compile the frontend on the fly with the webpack dev server in a seperate terminal:
`./bin/webpack-dev-server`


**Stuff thrown at the bottom for now *HELP ME ORGANIZE!**
Node wrapper around multicraft panel api to call server commands, ruby env variables passed into cli node call

Multicraft api can use website backend with node wrapper to privately message players with a pin for website login so no email/ect
